****** Read-Me file for LS335 Temperature Controller LabVIEW Program *******

Notes:
* LOG FILE SETTINGS:
You need to select the desired folder only, where you want the log files to be saved in. 
You may also change the prefix of the saved files.
The file will be stored as prefixYYYY_MM_DD.txt (default is Log_YYYY_MM_DD.txt).
Do this before starting the run.   
If you want to change the log settings during a run,
stop the run, change the settings, and then restart the run.

* AT STARTUP: if the program doesn't see the LS335, make sure that VISA ID is set to COM9 under the OPTIONS TAB.

* FOR RAMPING: first set and achieve the initial temperature you want to start a ramp from.
	Then input the desired temperature you want to ramp to, set the ramp rate, and then enable the 'Toggle Ramping' slider before pressing the 'Send Settings' button.
	Both the 'Ramp Enabled' and 'Ramp Busy' lights should be on and indicates that the LS335 is ramping to your desired temperature. NOTE: The 'Set Temp' indicator shows the steps towards the 'Target' temperature.
	
	Once the 'Ramp' busy lights are off, the LS335 has finished the ramp procedure.
	You may then either switch of the ramp slider which would revert the LS335 to the usual behaviour, or input a new set-point with the ramp slider still on. This will cause another ramp to occur.

	If 'Send Settings' is pressed again with the 'Toggle Ramping' switch enabled, the ramp target is adjusted to the new value.
